SSH - (S)ecure (SH)ell - Cryptographic Network Protocol

Used to access remote servers in a security way, the previous technique to do that was "telnet",
"telnet" was used to access remote servers, but all the data exchanged between client and server was
in plain text, in other words very INSECURE.


Symmetric encryption:
    Use a FUNCTION and a PRIVATE KEY

    One function that encrypt and decrypt data, but the function and the KEY need to be shared between the two parts,
    the client and the server, the problem is how to share the function and the KEY over the internet
    basically, this procedure is very insecure.


Asymmetric encryption:
    Use two FUNCTIONS and a pair of keys, PUBLIC KEY and PRIVATE KEY.
    The first function use the PUBLIC KEY to encrypt the data.
    The second functon use the PRIVATE KEY to decrypt the data.

    We share the PUBLIC KEY with everyone that we want to communicate, but the PRIVATE KEY as the name says is private.


How the flow works:
    1 - Client (A) request access to server (B) sending his PUBLIC KEY to the server verify or add in "known hosts".
    2 - The server (B) generate a TOP SECRET KEY and after that the server encrypt this TOP SECRET KEY with the client's 
        PUBLIC KEY and send back to the client.
    3 - The client decrypt the TOP SECRET KEY using his PRIVATE KEY because the server TOP SECRET KEY was encrypted using 
        the client PUBLIC KEY, after decrypt the TOP SECRET KEY the client send it to the server, the server then can verify
        the client identity and agree with the connection.
    4 - After that the SSH system creates a tunnel between the client and the server and the encrypted data can be pass through this tunnel.
